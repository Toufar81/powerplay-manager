"""Statistics helpers and recomputation routines.

Internal documentation is in English; user-facing strings remain Czech
(there are none here). Behavior is preserved. This module adds
Google-style docstrings, type hints, and light formatting.

Provided utilities:
    - :func:`player_season_totals_qs` – annotated totals for public FE, based on
      the ``PlayerSeasonTotals`` proxy.
    - :func:`games_for_team` – helper to list a team's games (home/away).
    - :func:`recompute_game` – recompute game score and per-game ``PlayerStats``
      from ``Goal``/``Penalty`` events and goalie assignments.
