"""Context helpers for injecting the primary team into templates.

Internal documentation is in English; all user-facing strings stay in Czech.
Behavior is preserved. Only docstrings, type hints, and light formatting were
added.

Notes:
    - ``_resolve_primary_team`` uses settings-driven resolution order and is
      cached with ``lru_cache(maxsize=1)`` for efficiency. Call
      ``_resolve_primary_team.cache_clear()`` after data changes (e.g., when the
      primary team is updated) to refresh the value within the running process.
    - ``select_related("league")`` is used to avoid extra queries in templates
      that display the league name.

    Resolution order:
        1. If ``settings.PRIMARY_TEAM_ID`` is set, return that team.
        2. Else if ``settings.PRIMARY_TEAM_NAME`` is set, perform a
           case-insensitive name match.
        3. Otherwise, return the first team in the database (lowest ``id``) as
           a safe fallback so pages can render something.

    Returns:
        Team | None: The resolved team, or ``None`` if the database is empty.

    Why:
        Keeps template logic simple, while centralizing the resolution and
        making it easily cacheable. Cache invalidation is manual via
        ``_resolve_primary_team.cache_clear()`` when necessary.
